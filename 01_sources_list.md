1. **BUS5001-Workshop-Week 10 – Dialogflow CX.pdf**  
   - Format: Lecture/Workshop slides (La Trobe Business School)  
   - Purpose: To test NotebookLM’s ability to summarise, explain, and extract procedural steps from an academic technical document.  

### Upload Context
The document introduces core Dialogflow CX concepts — Agents, Flows, Pages, Entity Types, Intents, Forms, Fulfilment, and Webhooks — and guides students through creating the *Breakfast Bot* project on Google Cloud.  
This single PDF provided enough theoretical and procedural content to evaluate NotebookLM’s summarisation, contextual Q&A, and synthesis features effectively.
