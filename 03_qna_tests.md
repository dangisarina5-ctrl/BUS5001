## Prompt 2
**“Explain in simple terms what a Dialogflow CX Agent, Flow, and Page are, and how they interact.”**

### NotebookLM Answer (Summary)
- **Agent:** Acts as the virtual assistant that interprets user input and manages conversations.  
- **Flow:** Defines a conversation topic (e.g., ‘Coffee Order’). An agent can have multiple flows.  
- **Page:** Represents a single conversational state within a flow, where specific information is collected.  
- **Interaction:** Agent → contains Flows → made up of Pages; pages transition to move the dialogue forward.
