## Observed Limitations and Bias

1. **Visual Content Exclusion:** NotebookLM ignored diagrams and images embedded in the PDF.  
2. **Minor Generalisations:** Occasionally added light analogies (“Choose Your Own Adventure” style) not in source.  
3. **No Cross-Source Testing:** Single-document evaluation meant cross-reference features not assessed.  
4. **Privacy Note:** Processing occurs within Google’s cloud environment; no explicit data-handling notice displayed.

## Critical Reflection
NotebookLM performed exceptionally well for a single-document study. Its summaries were accurate, procedural steps were clearly extracted, and no major hallucinations occurred.  
While visual elements were ignored, textual comprehension and context retention were excellent.  
Overall accuracy ≈ 95 %, usefulness ≈ 90 %.  

**Conclusion:** NotebookLM is highly effective for academic content review and summarisation but should be used alongside original slides for diagrammatic understanding.
